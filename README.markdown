## üìÑ Overview

**PyQt MindMapper Pro**, designed by Adrian Le≈õniak in 2023, is a desktop application developed using **Python** and the **PyQt5** GUI framework. It aims to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and organizing mind maps. Users can add and connect nodes, customize their appearance (shape, color, text), and arrange them on a canvas. The application includes a standard menu bar (File, Edit, Export, Help) and a toolbar for quick access to common functions. While core functionalities like node manipulation are present, features such as saving mind map projects and exporting them to PDF are currently placeholders (marked as TODO) awaiting full implementation.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   üß† **Node Management**:
    *   **Add Nodes**: Easily create new nodes on the mind map canvas.
    *   **Edit Nodes**: Modify the text content of nodes (typically by double-clicking).
    *   **Move Nodes**: Intuitively reposition nodes using drag-and-drop functionality.
    *   **Delete Nodes**: Remove selected nodes from the mind map.
*   üé® **Node Customization**:
    *   Change node **shapes** (e.g., rectangle, ellipse, diamond).
    *   Modify node **colors** (fill and/or border).
    *   Customize node **text** (font, size - if implemented).
    *   These options are typically accessible via a right-click context menu on a node.
*   üîó **Connections**:
    *   Create visual links (lines or curves) between nodes to represent relationships and structure the mind map.
    *   (Mechanism: e.g., select a node, click a "Connect" tool/menu item, then select the target node).
*   üíæ **File Operations (Partially Implemented)**:
    *   **Save Mind Map**: Intended functionality to save the current mind map project to a file (format to be defined). *(Marked as TODO)*
    *   **Export to PDF**: Intended functionality to export the visual representation of the mind map as a PDF document. *(Marked as TODO)*
*   üñ•Ô∏è **User Interface (PyQt5)**:
    *   **Main Window**: Provides the primary workspace.
    *   **Canvas Area**: The central drawing area where the mind map is constructed (logic assumed in `canvas.py`).
    *   **Toolbar**: Contains buttons for quick access to frequently used tools like "Add Node," "Connect Nodes," etc. (logic assumed in `toolbar.py`).
    *   **Menu Bar**: Standard application menu with options:
        *   `File`: (e.g., New, Open, Save, Save As, Exit)
        *   `Edit`: (e.g., Add Node, Delete Node, Edit Node Properties)
        *   `Export`: (e.g., Export as PDF, Export as Image)
        *   `Help`: (e.g., Instructions, About)
    *   **Instructions/Help**: Accessible via `Help > Instructions` to guide users.

## üñºÔ∏è Screenshots (Conceptual)

**Coming soon!**

_This section would ideally show screenshots of the PyQt MindMapper Pro application, including: the main window with the canvas, toolbar, and menu; examples of creating and connecting nodes; the node customization dialog/options; and the help/instructions window._

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements & Dependencies

### Software:
*   **Python**: Version 3.6 or higher.
*   **Libraries**:
    *   `PyQt5`: The core GUI framework.
    *   (No other external libraries are explicitly mentioned for the core functionality).

### Installation of Dependencies:
*   PyQt5 is installed using `pip`.

## üß© Assumed Core Modules (`canvas.py`, `toolbar.py`)

The application's functionality is likely distributed across several Python modules, with `main.py` orchestrating them. The overview assumes the existence of:

*   **`canvas.py`**: This module would contain the class(es) and logic responsible for:
    *   Rendering the mind map canvas (the drawing area).
    *   Handling the drawing of nodes and connections.
    *   Managing node positions, drag-and-drop interactions, and selection.
*   **`toolbar.py`**: This module would define the application's `QToolBar` (or a custom toolbar widget), populating it with `QAction`s for common operations like adding nodes, connecting, etc.

*The actual implementation of these modules is crucial and not provided in the overview snippet.*

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
    *(Replace `<repository-url>` and `<repository-directory>` with your specific details).*

2.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Required Libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install PyQt5
    # If a requirements.txt file is provided in the future:
    # pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Ensure Module Files are Present**:
    *   Place `main.py` (the main application script).
    *   Ensure `canvas.py` and `toolbar.py` (containing the canvas and toolbar logic, respectively) are in the same directory as `main.py` or that `main.py` can correctly import them (e.g., if they are in a sub-package).

5.  **Run the Application**:
    Open a terminal or command prompt in the project's root directory and execute:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## üí° Usage Guide

1.  Launch the application by running `python main.py` after completing the setup.
2.  **Interface Overview**:
    *   The main window will appear, featuring a menu bar (File, Edit, Export, Help), a toolbar with quick-action buttons, and a central canvas area for creating your mind map.
3.  **Core Controls & Actions**:
    *   **Add Node**:
        *   Click the "Add Node" button on the toolbar OR
        *   Select `Edit > Add Node` from the menu.
        *   A new node will appear on the canvas (or you might be prompted to click on the canvas to place it).
    *   **Edit Node Text**: Double-click on an existing node to modify its textual content.
    *   **Customize Node Appearance**: Right-click on a node to access a context menu with options to change its shape, color, font, etc.
    *   **Connect Nodes**:
        1.  Select a starting node.
        2.  Click the "Connect" button/tool on the toolbar or a similar menu option.
        3.  Select a target node to create a visual link between them.
    *   **Move Nodes**: Click and drag nodes on the canvas to reposition them as desired.
    *   **Delete Node(s)**: Select one or more nodes and press the `Delete` key on your keyboard, or use an option like `Edit > Delete`.
4.  **File Operations**:
    *   **Save**: Use `File > Save` (or Save As) to save your current mind map project. *(Note: This functionality is marked as a TODO/placeholder and needs implementation).*
    *   **Export**: Use `Export > Export as PDF` to generate a PDF version of your mind map. *(Note: This functionality is also a TODO/placeholder and needs implementation).*
5.  **Help**:
    *   Access `Help > Instructions` to view a guide on how to use the application's features.
6.  **Exiting**: Select `File > Exit` or close the main window.

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure (Expected)

*   `main.py`: The main Python script that initializes the PyQt5 application, sets up the main window, and integrates the canvas, toolbar, and menu functionalities.
*   `canvas.py`: (Assumed, User-provided/Project-included) Python module containing the class(es) for the mind map drawing canvas, node rendering, and interaction logic.
*   `toolbar.py`: (Assumed, User-provided/Project-included) Python module for defining and managing the application's toolbar.
*   `README.md`: This documentation file.
*   (Potentially other Python modules for specific functionalities like PDF export, file serialization, etc.)

## üìù Technical Notes & Considerations

*   **Placeholder Functionality**: Key features like **saving mind maps** and **exporting to PDF** are explicitly marked as "TODO" and require full implementation.
*   **Module Dependencies (`canvas.py`, `toolbar.py`)**: The successful operation of `main.py` heavily depends on the correct implementation and integration of the `canvas.py` and `toolbar.py` modules, which are assumed to exist but not detailed in the provided code snippet.
*   **PyQt5 Event Loop**: The application runs within the PyQt5 event loop, handling user interactions (mouse clicks, key presses, menu selections) through signals and slots.
*   **Error Handling**: While not detailed, a robust desktop application would include error handling for file operations, invalid user actions, etc.
*   **Cross-Platform Potential**: PyQt5 is a cross-platform framework. If platform-specific OS calls are avoided, the application should be largely portable across Windows, macOS, and Linux (assuming Python and PyQt5 are installed).
